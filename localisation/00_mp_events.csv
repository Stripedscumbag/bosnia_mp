CAB1OPTA;Investigate the Temple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CAB1OPTB;Let's not mess with that what is old.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CAB_TITLE_2;A Tomb of a Great Sage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CAB_DESC_2;Many explorers have delved deep into the temple and have found a large tomb with inscriptions reading : ':cabbage: 'The Great Sage of all the Cabbages' '. However upon opening the casket a mere :rottencabbage: was found laying inside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CAB2OPTA;We must find the true Cabbage Sage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CAB_TITLE_3;Findings from the Temple;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CAB_DESC_3;After a few more months of exploration we have decrypted some tomes in the library and I have learned alot from the ancient past that we have left behind. However these Cabbages they knew what they were doing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CAB3OPTA;Cabbage script is Georgian?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CAB_TITLE_4;A Disciple of the Sage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CAB_DESC_4;My men have found a disciple Cabbage of the Sage. He claims to have been slowly rotting down in the temple ever since mankind started growing grain and breeding all kinds of cattle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CAB4OPTA;I will accept his guidance either way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CAB_TITLE_5;Peace of mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CAB_DESC_5;After a grueling year of training, my mentor has commended me on my progress. He says that I have learned alot about the history of the Cabbage people and their ways and that I am a pious man. He even believes I have it in me to become a Cabbage myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CAB5OPTA;Me, a Cabbage? You mean it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CAB_TITLE_6;Change in form.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CAB_DESC_6;Ever since my mentor commended me own my dilligence, I have felt a flaky feeling on my skin. Many people in my court have also pointed out that I have become more docile and started looking green. However untill recently I didn't really think of it till my mentor told me that I would turn a Cabbage soon. Later, now that I have actually become one, what shall I do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CAB6OPTA;I must strive to become a Sage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CAB6OPTB;I am contempt with how it went.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CAB_TITLE_7;Ways of the Sage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CAB_DESC_7;In order for me to become a Cabbage Sage, a most holy person in the Cabbage culture, I must first undergo a bonebreaking routine. Despite all of that I feel like a wiser man by the day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CAB7OPTA;Mmmmm :cabbage:…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CAB_TITLE_8;Struggling with Cabbageness;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

CAB8OPTA;Crazy… anyways…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CAB_TITLE_9;A Great Cabbage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

TITLE_NOR1;Formation of the Danelaw;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DESC_NOR1;With the invasion of England by the Norsemen we have found ourselves settled on the lands of the Saxons. Ever since we departed from Scandinavia many brave warriors came along to find fame and riches, however there were also men who found their way onto the land that the Saxons had left behind. Finding ourselves in a period of peace we have decided to officially form the Danelaw on the lands that we first made contact with. \n \nNot so long after settling down have our men gone around and pillaged Britannia and beyond, finding themselves kidnapping many slaves. Some even find true love in their property and are embracing certain traditions that the Saxons once used to practice on these lands. It is up to me to embrace this new way of life that has spawned itself within my realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
