# Give Orthodox Great Holy Wars, but not the crusade mechanics. Somewhat like a pagan holy war, which means you only get land but nothing else if you win.
# Give the Byzantium Empire, the ability to conquer De Jure territory for duchies for free, essentially like the Roman Empire CB.
# Give Orthodox +3 Learning
# Give Orthodox a modifer of 15% National Tax Modifier with the name being "Jewish Tolerance". 
# Orthodox cannot expel Jews. 

Some of these sound kind of stupid and unnecessary in my opinion.
